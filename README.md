## Installation

In order to use the README Generator, you will need to install Node.js onto your computer. Then you will need to do a git clone to get the repo so you have a copy of the generator. Next, you will need to use your terminal to install the following libraries; inquirer and fs. To do so, type npm install and the name of the library (example: npm install inquirer). Once you have everything installed, you will enter node index.js into your terminal and answer the prompted questions. Once all of the questions are answered, your professional README.md file will be generated and ready for use.
